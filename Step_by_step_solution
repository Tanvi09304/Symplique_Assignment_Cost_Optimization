1. Cost Optimization & Data Archival: Approach
a. Archive Old Data to Azure Blob Storage
Why? Rarely read data (>3 months old) drives up Cosmos DB storage and RU costs. Blob Storage is much cheaper for archival and tolerates higher latency.

How?

Move records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage (preferably in JSON or Parquet format for easy retrieval).

Consider using Blob Storage “Cool” or “Archive” access tier for further savings, since you accept seconds-level latency.

b. Retrieval Strategy
When a request for old data arrives, the system first checks Cosmos DB:

If found: Return immediately.

If not found: Fetch from Blob Storage, rehydrate if needed, and serve (possibly caching back in Cosmos DB or a cache for subsequent requests).

2. Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy
Start with full read/write access in Cosmos DB.

Archival Job: Use Azure Data Factory or an Azure Function scheduled job to:

Identify records older than 3 months.

Copy them to Azure Blob Storage (in batch jobs).

After successful copy, flag or delete in Cosmos DB to free up storage.

No API contract changes: The archival/retrieval logic should be implemented behind the scenes in your backend or in a middleware Azure Function/Logic App triggered by API calls or proxies, thus preserving the existing API.

Important: Test thoroughly in a staging environment to prevent data loss and ensure zero downtime.

3. Serving Archived Data Seamlessly
Use a “proxy” or transparent cache layer (e.g., API facade with Azure Functions, or a reverse proxy with logic) that intercepts requests:

If data not present in Cosmos DB, tries to fetch from Blob.

Optionally, re-inserts frequently accessed archived records back to Cosmos DB or an in-memory cache (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis) to reduce future latency.

This keeps your API contract unchanged.

5. Pseudocode/Scripts
a. Archiving Old Records
Azure Function or Data Factory Pipeline Pseudocode:

python
# Run daily/weekly, triggered as Timer Function or ADF schedule
for record in cosmosdb.query("SELECT * FROM records WHERE timestamp < (NOW() - 90 days)"):
    blob_path = f"archive/{record.id}.json"
    blob_storage.write(blob_path, record)
    # Optional: Delete or update record in Cosmos DB
    cosmosdb.delete(record.id)
Using Azure CLI (Data Factory) to Export and Archive
bash
az datafactory pipeline create-run --factory-name <factory> --resource-group <rg> --name ArchiveOldRecordsPipeline
Pipeline would:

Query Cosmos DB via Data Factory connector

Filter for records older than 3 months

Write to Azure Blob Storage sink

b. Accessing Archived Records (Azure Function example)
python
def get_billing_record(record_id):
    record = cosmosdb.get(record_id)
    if record:
        return record
    else:
        # If not found, try Blob Storage
        blob_path = f"archive/{record_id}.json"
        record = blob_storage.read(blob_path)
        if record:
            # Optional: cache in Cosmos DB or Redis
            # cosmosdb.write(record)
            return record
        else:
            return None
c. Cost Monitoring/Management
Enable alerts and budgets in Azure Cost Management.

Use Azure Monitor Workbooks to track Blob Storage and Cosmos DB metrics and costs.

Example: Set up Azure Alert when storage usage approaches certain thresholds.

6. Best Practices
Indexing: Fine-tune Cosmos DB indexing policies—index only fields you need for queries; keep archived data indexing to a minimum before export.

Partitioning: Regularly check hot/cold partition usage for balance.

Security: Ensure both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage have proper access control and encryption.

Backup: Make backups before running archival/deletion scripts.

7. Serverless/Data Tiering Patterns
Event-Driven Archival: Use Cosmos DB Change Feed to trigger archiving (for future data). For historical, use batch migration with ADF/Azure Functions.

Function-as-a-Proxy: An Azure Function or Logic App that fronts all reads and manages Cosmos DB/Blob Storage routing seamlessly.

Cache-aside: Integrate Azure Redis Cache if latency for “cold” Blob requests needs further optimization.

8. Bonus: Transparent Proxy/Cache Layer
Deploy an Azure API Management Gateway or implement an application-level reverse proxy (e.g., with Azure Functions or App Gateway) that intercepts calls, checks Cosmos DB, then falls back to Blob Storage if needed (using the logic above).

Optionally: use Redis or another in-memory cache to speed up access of recently requested archived data.

Key Technologies:

Azure Cosmos DB (hot, recent data)

Azure Blob Storage (cool/archive, old data)

Azure Data Factory or Azure Functions (for ETL archiving jobs)

Azure Functions or Logic Apps (for API proxy or “archive fetch” logic)

Azure Monitor + Cost Management (for tracking spend)

This solution ensures cost savings in storage/compute, no downtime, no API contract changes, low maintenance, and a scalable serverless architecture tailored for your application scenario
